# DueWeave — Customer Release Readiness

**Prepared:** 2026-10-09  
**Repository:** Pavithran-R-A/DueWeave, branch `release/consumer-live`  
**Site:** https://dueweave.pages.dev  
**Backend:** DueWeave Production, project `ugzdqcytouwfdlcjujqv`  
**Claim permitted today:** publicly deployed release candidate, **not** 100% customer-ready.

This document separates verified evidence from customer-facing promises. A green build and a
successful unauthenticated screenshot do not establish end-to-end customer acceptance.
Any later SHA must earn its own CI and deployment verification.

## Evidence already obtained

| Customer promise or invariant | Evidence | Classification |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Public HTTPS and anonymous auth-page rendering | Cloudflare Pages Git deployment and separate real-Chromium public-route smoke | Verified for unauthenticated screens |
| Mobile login form, signup form validation, forgot-password navigation, route guards, favicon and manifest | `e2e-live/public-release.spec.ts` on `https://dueweave.pages.dev`, no data created | Verified for tested paths, not signup delivery |
| Database authorization, tenant separation and anonymous isolation | Hosted Phase 3B two-account isolation matrix; 13/13 public tables RLS-enabled; anon/PUBLIC routine EXECUTE zero | Verified for measured hosted matrix |
| Monetary dates, receivable/promise/payment history, exports, Founder refusal behavior and customer journeys | Vitest, pgTAP, DB/live, and Playwright local-stack CI gates; consult exact-head run, not earlier counts | Locally gated; real hosted-browser acceptance outstanding |
| User-owned account erasure with history | Production migration 25 and transaction-rollback database acceptance | Database side verified; live cross-origin browser erasure not yet proved |
| Real hosted frontend source and Supabase config | Pages project production branch `release/consumer-live`, build `pnpm build`, output `dist`, active Supabase URL/publishable-key envs | Deployment state verified; exact-head certification required |
| Full ledger and downloadable archive past PostgREST 1,000-row default limit | Page-by-page queries with stable order, unit tests for 1,201 rows and errors | Code+unit gated; full live large-data export outstanding |
| Password and Auth network errors do not strand the form | Guarded `try/catch/finally` and friendly error responses | Code+static gate; adverse browser-network simulation outstanding |

## Blocking gates before the words “100% customer-ready”

1. **Email signup and password recovery:** Supabase's built-in sender is not suitable for
   public production accounts; the connected Resend account has **no verified sending domain**.
   Configure a legitimate production SMTP identity/domain, verify SPF/DKIM/DMARC, and execute
   signup-confirmation and password-recovery acceptance with a real mailbox. Do not claim an email
   arrived based only on an API 200 or a local test inbox.
2. **Auth URL configuration:** Re-read hosted Site URL, exact redirect allow-list, signup
   confirmation settings, SMTP identity and rate limits. Historical production measurement had
   Site URL `http://localhost:3000` and password minimum 6; set Site URL to
   `https://dueweave.pages.dev`, allow exactly required HTTPS recovery redirects, set
   hosted password minimum to 8, then independently re-measure and test.
3. **Live signed-in customer acceptance:** Use disposable verified QA users in a real production
   browser. Test onboarding; client/receivable create/edit; partial payments; promise creation,
   withdrawal and timeline; follow-up drafts and manual WhatsApp handoff; snooze; free-tier cap;
   search, dark mode, export/download, signout, account erasure, and cross-account refusal.
   Assert before/after DB rows and remove every QA user/artifact. No customer funds.
4. **Account-deletion runtime:** Redeploy the updated `delete-account` source after exact-head
   gates. Test browser CORS preflight (including `apikey` and `x-client-info`) and the complete
   Auth-account removal, not just a transaction-scoped SQL simulation.
5. **Founder monetization:** Production readiness deliberately reports `false`; no actual live
   UPI destination, approved support/refund/disclosures or reviewer allowlist. Do not collect or
   represent real Founder payments as enabled. Finish operator decisions and perform refund/manual
   review tests separately, or explicitly release only the free plan without a purchasable offer.
6. **Customer trust, support and compliance:** Publish an accurate privacy policy, terms,
   data-retention and deletion policy, and real reachable support address. Verify jurisdiction and
   payment disclosures with the business operator; do not invent a support mailbox or payment details.
7. **Durability, abuse and performance:** Define zero-cost backup/restore and incident response
   appropriate to the hosted Free plan (no PITR), anti-abuse/rate-limit acceptance, load estimates,
   and investigate the five informational unindexed foreign keys using measured workloads.
8. **Release governance:** Reconcile the long-lived `main` branch, branch/PR protection, final
   changelog and operations rollback; verify head==GitHub CI SHA==Pages deployed SHA, all intended
   gates pass, and no secret is in Git or client assets. The repository is temporarily public for
   hosted Actions and must not silently be called private.
9. **Temporary QA cloud cleanup:** `DueWeave Validation` was paused but is **not confirmed
   permanently deleted**; this administrative cleanup remains open.

## Release verdict

**NOT CERTIFIED FOR A GENERAL PUBLIC CUSTOMER LAUNCH.**

Keep the Founder payment gate fail-closed, do not advertise a 100%-ready release, and preserve
the passing local and hosted evidence. Convert every row above into a measured green gate before
signoff. This checklist is a release audit, not a guarantee that an untested line contains no bug.
